        <div class="white-text story-summary">My older sister's toys were stolen from me, I ruined my mother's
            cosmetics, and I overindulged in sugar when I was younger. I'm afraid of a lot of things, like being alone
            or being left out of activities. I'm also afraid of drowning and insects. Every time an insect flew by, I
            was the one who would jump in fear. None of my siblings even raised an eyebrow. In the end, I would always
            flee and humiliate myself in front of others. I've chosen not to allow my concerns stop me from doing
            something, even if I've never been close to an ocean, river, or lake before. The next step for me will be to
            find and accomplish a goal. There are a lot of things that will keep me from achieving my objective. I'll
            have to give it my all. My ultimate objective is to become an Accountant, and I'll do all in my ability to
            get there.</div>
